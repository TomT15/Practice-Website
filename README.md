# Practice-Website
This is a website I am building for practice.

# Future Updates

JQueries will be used to setup forms to have an email sent to the client when someone is interested in their art. The party that is interested can write a message and it will also be sent in that email.

CSS will be redone so that there is more responsiveness

Overall functionality of the website will be redone after my client has had time to see what he likes and does not. For example, when you are in the Gallery #2, you can click on the picture and it will pull up while blackening out everything else. This cannot be done for the other sets of photos.
